## Hey there âœ¨

I'm Era, I don't do very much but that which I do is to the best of my ability (or so I hope.) I'm a fullstack engineer working a lot with Kotlin, Rust and TypeScript in order to build future proof and scaleable infrastructure. 

If you're here because of [Xiana](https://xiana.cc) that's great! As of writing this Xiana is stil in development but hopefully you enjoyed the product. Direct any support questions or queries to the respect discord server or support email provided on the site. 

If you'd like my personal website you can find me [here](https://osa-is.online). I am very active on [BlueSky](https://bsky.app/profile/era3037.bsky.social) where I post semi often and [Discord](https://discord.com/users/496432681614180382).

Best regards and thanks for reading,
Osa
